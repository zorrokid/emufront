0.1.3a	2010-11-13
	- Created initial support for M.A.M.E and similar (the container zip
	  is used as is).
	- Fixed: Fixed a bug with regular expression (If filename was one
	  character, it wasn't included. Also if the file length column started without empty 
	  space it wasn't scanned).
	- Fixed: Regular expression. If dates in unzip output was in wrong format, the files were not
	  added.
	- Fixed: main window of configuration editor remained disabled,
	  if the editor window was closed from window manager and not by
		  'Done' button.
	- Database changes, delete old database:
	
$ emufront reset
	  
	- or update your database:

$ sqlite3 ~/my.db.sqlite
> alter table file add column extname;
> .quit
